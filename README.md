# Game2D_OOP

Based on Hungarian A&K Akadémia BasicGame tutorials.

Features:
	It always generates a field in which there are no enclosed spaces.
  
	By default, the enemy (@) is chasing the player (O).
  
	A power-up (*)appears at a certain number of rounds, which the player tries to pick up.
  
	If the player picks up the power-up, it will chase the enemy, the enemy will escape.
  
	The effect of the power-up disappears over time, at which point the original order is restored.
  
	The character that escapes goes to the farthest point of the field.
  
	The characters move smartly, avoid obstacles, and go the shortest way.
  
  The paradigm change from in-line code to OOP.
